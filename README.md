# Cloud, DevOps and SRE Resources for Everyone
## Overview:

This is a repo to collect resources beneficial to DevOps and SRE of all levels. Ideally what I would like this repo to follow is an emphasis on perceived expectations of level of material (**Novice, Competent, Proficient**). To keep things organized for the time being, we'll use headings for topics and tables for the rest of the information.
