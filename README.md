# DevOps and SRE Resources for Everyone
## Overview:

This is a repo to collect resources beneficial to DevOps and SRE of all levels. Ideally what I would like this repo to follow is an emphasis on perceived expectations of level of material (**Novice, Competent, Proficient**). To keep things organized for the time being, we'll use headings for topics and tables for the rest of the information.

# General
Think of this as a catch all for material that doesn't fall into a neat category
| Link | Experience Level | Cost | Description |
| :----| :----: | :----:| :---- |
| [Kodekloud Engineer](https://www.kodekloud-engineer.com)| Novice | Free | This is a unique resource. Kodekloud is know for their hands on labs and they've taken that same technology and use it to simulate working in a technical environment. You get assigned a task, you have a Wiki with the environment info, and you complete the task. It simulates working in a real environment and the challenges/tasks you may come across. |
# Kubernetes
| Link | Experience Level | Cost | Description |
